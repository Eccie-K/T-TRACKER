<b>Triangle Tracker</b>

Triangle Tracker is a web page that allows the user to enter the lengths of the sides of a triangle. After entering the lengths in number, it returns whether the triangle is equilateral,isosceles,scalene or not a triangle at all. 
Look at it as a ‘game’ that comes in handy to individuals who are learning about triangles or those who want to understand more about triangles.

<b>Functionality:</b><br>
This application is supposed to do the following:<br>
    • Have three clearly displayed places with instructions for  users to enter values. <br>
    • A submit button should be there,right below the spaces for entering values.<br>
    • For an equilateral triangle,all sides are equal. Therefore, users should enter the same value in each of the three   spaces provided. This should display the word “EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE:ALL SIDES ARE EQUAL.”<br>
    • For an isosceles triangle,exactly two sides are equal. The users should enter the same value in two of the spaces provided. This should display “isosceles triangle: “ISOSCELES TRIANGLE:TWO SIDES ARE EQUAL.”<br>
    • For a scalene triangle,none of the sides are equal. Users should enter different values in the spaces provided. This should display the word “SCALENE TRIANGLE: NO SIDES ARE EQUAL.”<br>
    • If the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side, “THIS IS NOT A TRIANGLE” should be displayed.<br>
